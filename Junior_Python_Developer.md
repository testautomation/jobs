# CircleCI, Azure Pipeline, Github Actions
```



We are looking for a full time junior Developer with at least some basic programming skills in any programming language. You don't need to have any previous experience with Robot Framework or Python - having knowledge in one or both would be a big plus, though. But you MUST have the willingness to learn and you should be curious about Python and topics like software quality, continuous integration, test automation, continuous testing and DevOps (DevSecOps). You will be able to learn and use state of the art Open Source tools, technologies and best practices. You will learn how to troubleshoot difficult problems and get insights into any important part of a software development lifecycle including reading and understanding of requirements, implementing & debugging (test) code and writing technical documentation.

We will teach you everything you need for the job - but **you must be proactive**. We will also learn from you, listen to your ideas and innovations. We can help you to build the foundation to a lucrative and future-proof career as a Test Automation Engineer a.k.a Software Quality Engineer. Later you will have the opportunity to work onsite with our customers in Europe/Germany if you like.

If you ask yourself "is it worth to become a Test Automation Engineer
instead of following a developer career path?" here are some thoughts for you
to consider: The world is moving fast towards making almost everything digital
(digital transformation shizzle). Software will rule the world.

That's why software quality is crucial - it is increasingly becoming a critical
success factor. Low quality software will not survive. High software quality on
the other hand is impossible to achieve in a world of Agile and DevOps without
sustainable test automation in place.
Mature software quality assurance with test automation, continuous testing and
DevSecOps in place is what will move software development from Art to an
engineering discipline.

The demand for IT experts is enormous but so is the competition among developers.
Everybody wants to become a fullstack developer or software architect but only
few are aware of the profession of test automation engineers and the fact
that they earn more money than the majority of developers simple due to the fact
that they have almost no competitors - it's like they are unicorns.
